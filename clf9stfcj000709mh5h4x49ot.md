Do you ever get tired of doing the same thing over and over again? I know I do! But do you know that computers can feel the same way?

That's why we have something called "while loops" in computer programming.

A while loop is like a set of instructions that tells the computer to keep doing something until it reaches a specific goal. It's like when we play games with rules. For example, when we play chess, the rule is to keep playing till either player checkmates the other or they reach a stalemate. We keep playing until either of the goals are achieved.

In computer programming, we use while loops to do something repeatedly until it reaches a specific goal. For example, let's say we want the computer to count from 1 to 10. we can tell it to "keep counting until you reach 10". The computer will follow this rule and count to 10.

Here's another example of how a while loop might work in a guessing game:

The while loop keeps going until we guess the correct number. We keep guessing till we get it right!

So, while loops are like a set of instructions that tell the computer to do something repeatedly until it reaches a specific goal. Remember, it's like playing a game with rules.
